## Icons for budgie-media-player-applet

In this folder are all the icons the applet uses, I didnâ€™t draw any of these icons.

Some icons are used as a fallback, when your icon theme doesn't support them, 
others are unique to this applet as there are not any suitable standard icons.

**Icons are from [papirus icon theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)**
