## Icons for the budgie-media-player-applet

This folder contains all the icons used by the applet. It’s important to note that I didn't create any of these icons myself.

- **Fallback Icons:** Some of these icons serve as fallbacks. They come into play when your icon theme doesn't support specific icons.
- **Unique Icons:** Others are unique to this applet because there aren’t suitable standard icons available.

**These icons are sourced from the [Papirus icon theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme).**
